A PWA for tracking exercise built using React, Nextjs and Apollo Client.

Production endpoint: https://physio-tracker.now.sh/

Graphql API backend: https://github.com/RobynBlanchard/prisma-physio-tracker-api

Reasoning behind app:
* As part of my physio program I needed to be able to track exercise metrics for the left and right leg separately. Therefore I created an application to allows the user to create their own exercises and specify the metrics they want to measure.
