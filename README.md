A PWA for tracking exercise built using React, Nextjs and Apollo Client.

Production endpoint: https://physio-tracker.now.sh/

Graohql API backend: https://github.com/RobynBlanchard/prisma-physio-tracker-api

Reasoning behind app:
* As part of my physio program after recovering my a knee operation I needed to be able to track the left and right leg separately, eg leg press left leg, left leg right leg. With the applications I was using this functionality wasn't available so I built an app that alongside preset exercises allows the user to add a custom exercise and add the metrics they want to measure as part of that
